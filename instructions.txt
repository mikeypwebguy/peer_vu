Code Challenge: Popular PHP Repositories on GitHub Using PHP and MySQL, complete the following:
1    Use the GitHub API to retrieve the most starred public PHP projects. Store the list of repositories in a MySQL table. The table must contain the repository ID, name, URL, created date, last push date, description, and number of stars. This process should also be able to update existing project details.
2    Using the data in the table created in step 1, create an interface that displays a list of the GitHub repositories and allows the user to click through to view details on each one. Be sure to include all of the fields in step 1 â€“ displayed in either the list or detailed view.
Create a README file with a description of your architecture and notes on installation of your application. You are free to use any PHP, JavaScript, or CSS frameworks as you see fit, or none at all.
